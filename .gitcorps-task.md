## Required Workflow

1. Read VISION.md and STATUS.md before making changes.

3. Use test-first development when feasible.
4. Implement focused changes for the milestone.
5. Run tests where available and fix in-scope failures.
6. Update STATUS.md with attempted work, changes, working state, broken state, and next milestone.
7. Keep edits incremental and avoid unnecessary rewrites.

## Constraints

- If blocked, document blocker details and concrete next step in STATUS.md.
